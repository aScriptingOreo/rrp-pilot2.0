## Issues & Proposals
    For each Issue I will attempt to provide a solution with RP as the end goal.

- Flying without licenses
    >   ``The acquisition of licenses are no required by the majority of the playerbase that wants to purchase or fly aircraft, anyone can buy an aircraft off the catalogue and/or steal any aircraft they can get their hands on. While doing any of those, the player still perform flawlessly without any acquired knowledge from it's character.``     
    > [Here's how hard it is to hover a helicopter](https://youtu.be/eXR1olg_I0w?t=234) according to an aerospace engineer

    -   Proposal #1
        -   Implementing something like [Turbulence](https://github.com/Vumono/Turbulence/tree/main) in order to dissuade inexperienced characters from taking off, this would reinforce how dangerous it actually is to attempt to operate an aircraft without either a license or a pilot by your side.
        -   Turbulence could be integrated with RRP skills system, flight skill gain could be 0.02% instead of 0.2%, but with an instructor aboard the aircraft, that gain should be higher.
        -   Pilots would have even higher rate of skill gain rate.
        -   Pilots and Police Officers would have a higher flight skill cap.


    - Proposal #2
      - Having a check ran before aicraft purchase, same as PDM, having a pilot online and inside the hangar to oversee the purchase and to check the licenses.

-   Long Term Profitability & Licensing
    >   ```The main way to make money as a pilot currently is by the passive income of being on the clock and flying wealthy clients around the island for sightseeing. Pilots depend on issuing licenses to other individuals, but that only becomes a possibility at a specific rank within the job.```

    -   Proposal
        -   Introduce a qualification based license system(this could be done all through RP and spreadsheets), where there would be multiple different qualifications needed to be elegible for the flight exam.
        -   All citizens with licenses would need to be retrained but this could be arranged through RP.
        -   Any pilot would be able to charge for flight lessons where they would actually teach and allow the applicants to practice while increasing their flight skill faster.
        -   Only Senior pilots or above would be able to issue licenses and perform flight exams.
        -   Allow people to call for an AirTow as well as a normal Tow, Cargobobs can be used by the lowest rank of pilot so any pilot can profit off it.
        -   [Add magnet functionality to the Skylift helicopter](https://pt.gta5-mods.com/scripts/working-skylift-magnet-gtalua) so higher rank pilots can lift heavier cargo, in turn being paid more.
        -   Add something like [Taximeter](https://github.com/michaelhodgejr/esx_taximeter) so it is easier for pilots to estimate prices based on type of cargo and weight.

-   License expiration
    >```With licenses being a one time purchase, we create a finite interaction pool between the pilots and the general population, the current way that it is done feels rather unnoficial, the license cards don't have expiration dates, so there is no visual indication one needs to get it renewed.```

    - Proposal:
      - A regular interval of time that would render a license expired status, making so the license holders would need renew their licenses. This would require the license holder to redo their practical test. 
      - Having the license expiration date on the license card just like the hunting licenses would be ideal.

## Metabase References
>With some inconsistent work done by the previous pilots most of our currently logged licenses don't contain phone numbers for renewals, there is no way to actually pull that information consistently, information in which should've been logged from the start.
-   A metabase display of all the people that have been licensed, with the following information if possible:

    | Name | Phone Number | License Issued at | Issued by|
    |-- |-- |-- |-- |

## Transponders
>"In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. In a communications satellite, a satellite transponder receives signals over a range of uplink frequencies, usually from a satellite ground station; the transponder amplifies them, and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals." - [Wikepedia Article on Transponders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder)
- Adding a transponder system to aircraft that would reveal them in the sky for other aircraft. Basically add a player marker when someone is inside an aircraft, but only for others inside aircrafts as well.
- Only licensed pilots would be able to disable the transponder, as they have been taught how to do so.
- Add a way to disable the transponder (/transponderoff) so they can opperate hidden, but doing so would alert the ATC/Police/Pilots, as it is a federal crime to fly with your transponder off.

## ATC
>ATC should be recognized as a real entity over San Andreas. But there shouldn't be ATC Roleplay, as it is basically like talking to a wall, as of now we don't have enough of a population in the server to justify dedicated ATC personnel nor enough pilots in the sky.
-   Changing city laws to accomodate this would be crucial.

## Fixed Wing Aircraft tweaks
> There is no real reason to purchase one of the many fixed wing aircraft on the catalogue, they function similarly to rotary aircraft but without the vertical take-off/landing.
-   Increasing their top speed and acceleration would make them more exciting for buyers and the ones flying them. This would, of course, increase the likelyhood of someone buying it.

## Clock in Stations
>Having a clock in station on every airport would be ideal, flying from paleto to LSIA is rather time consuming.
-   Having clock in stations on Sandy Shores.
-   No need to add one for Grapeseed International Shack, it would make clocking in and out too trivial.

## Hobby Licenses - Powergaming 2: Electric Bogaloo
> These should be at least 500k per, 150k to the issuer and 350k to the government, this is in no way intended to make pilots richer, it is a literal discouragement to players getting them. Having that much power to just spawn a helicopter or a plane is quite unbalanced for crime holders.
-   With transponders we would be able to control this better, but still.


## Elitism, as it should
-   Gating
    -   Pilots should be gated just as much as judges and cops, there is an immense ammount of power in the hands of a pilot, not just destructive but crime wise, the people willing to become pilots need to be heavily scrutinized before allowed to operate aircraft.

## Crime and Pilots
> Pilots should be allowed to use their aircraft in crime, either clocked in or out, but always ready to face the consequences tied to the use. 
-   Having pilots be able to do crime would increase the appeal of the job for the player population.
-   Criminal crews would have a reason to hire a pilot (that sounds cool in my head).
-   HEAVY punishment if caught in the act, it's high risk high reward.
-   Vehicles would need to be agreed upon with cops, cargobobs would only be used for high value jobs or extractions. I.e. Pacific or Green Card.

## Plane Smoke
> Include the script for plane smoke toggling so airshows can be more entertaining.
-   Included plane smoke script as a submodule of this repository.

## Money stuff
-   Commissions
    -   Aircraft prices should be lowered by 10% and a 10% commission should be in place for the pilot selling the aircraft. The buyer doesn't feel a difference, the seller will have a nice bag of change, compared to PDM, the Aicraft market receives insanely less traffic, so a commission that high would make sense to help pilots stay motivated.
-   Licensing fees
    - Instructor pilots would work together with the Senior Captains in the licensing process, as instructors would prepare the students for their practical exam 
     -   The pricing for licenses can't be comprehensive, there should be monthly discussions on price adjustments for the licenses and renewals, this should be based on a current state of economy instead of being a fixed value.

## Existing Aircraft Owners
>They won't be happy with status quo changes. The most important thing is that they understand how insanely difficult it actually is to fly an aircraft and that they will not be able to just magically buy one and go [flying like Tom Cruise](https://youtu.be/WLKpgzXHKLA?t=52) around buildings and mountains.

>In order for them to properly use the aircraft, they'd need to go through the training. They may get frustrated but it is sadly a necessity, they've been granted way too big of a power for nothing more than a sloppy driver's exam in the sky.


- Discounted licensing for aircraft owners.
- Fast tracked certifications and exams.



# Non essential QOL suggestions

## XNLRealPlanes
> This would add TCAS, GPWS, Custom sound and interiors to most aircraft, automated landing sequences for fixed wing aircraft, separate airspaces based on aircraft types and many other Quality of Life features. [Here is the full feature list](https://github.com/VenomXNL/XNLRealPlanes#-main-features).
- The script is in the repo as a submodule, but not at all a major point of this overhaul.
- It has no ESX version and the creator doesn't seem to be interested in creating one. I reckon the feature list on the script will be used rather as basis for custom QOL changes and implementations.

## Camera functionality
> Add the camera functionality to aircraft that don't have it.
-   The camera script does not seem to have been hooked to the Buzzard2 (non police version).
-   Adding camera functionality to some planes may increase the likelyhood of people buying them.
