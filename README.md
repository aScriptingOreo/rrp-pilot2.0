## Issues & Proposals
    For each Issue I will attempt to provide a solution with RP as the end goal.

- Flying without licenses
    >   ``The acquisition of licenses are no required by the majority of the playerbase that wants to purchase or fly aircraft, anyone can buy an aircraft off the catalogue and/or steal any aircraft they can get their hands on. While doing any of those, the player still perform flawlessly without any acquired knowledge from it's character.``     
    > [Here's how hard it is to hover a helicopter](https://youtu.be/eXR1olg_I0w?t=234) according to an aerospace engineer

    -   Proposal #1
        -   Implementing something like [Turbulence](https://github.com/Vumono/Turbulence/tree/main) in order to dissuade inexperienced characters from taking off, this would reinforce how dangerous it actually is to attempt to operate an aircraft without either a license or a pilot by your side.
        -   Turbulence could be integrated with RRP skills system, flight skill gain could be 0.02% instead of 0.2%, but with an instructor aboard the aircraft, that gain should be higher.
        -   Pilots would have even higher rate of skill gain rate.
        -   Pilots and Police Officers would have a higher flight skill cap.


    - Proposal #2
      - Having a check ran before aicraft purchase, same as PDM, having a pilot online and inside the hangar to oversee the purchase and to check the licenses.

-   Long Term Profitability & Licensing
    >   ```The main way to make money as a pilot currently is by the passive income of being on the clock and flying wealthy clients around the island for sightseeing. Pilots depend on issuing licenses to other individuals, but that only becomes a possibility at a specific rank within the job.```

    -   Proposal
        -   Introduce a qualification based license system(this could be done all through RP and spreadsheets), where there would be multiple different qualifications needed to be elegible for the flight exam.
        -   All citizens with licenses would need to be retrained but this could be arranged through RP.
        -   Aby pilot would be able to charge for flight lessons, where they would actually teach and allow the applicants to practice while increasing their flight skill faster.
        -   Only Senior pilots or above would be able to put
        -   Allow people to call for an AirTow as well as a normal Tow, Cargobobs can be used by the lowest rank of pilot so any pilot can profit off it.
        -   [Add magnet functionality to the Skylift helicopter](https://pt.gta5-mods.com/scripts/working-skylift-magnet-gtalua) so higher rank pilots can lift heavier cargo, in turn being paid more.
        -   Add something like [Taximeter](https://github.com/michaelhodgejr/esx_taximeter) so it is easier for pilots to estimate prices based on type of cargo and weight.

-   License expiration
    >```With licenses being a one time purchase, we create a finite interaction pool between the pilots and the general population, the current way that it is done feels rather unnoficial, the license cards don't have expiration dates, so there is no visual indication one needs to get it renewed.```

    - Proposal:
      - A regular interval of time that would render a license expired status, making so the license holders would need renew their licenses. This would require the license holder to redo their practical test. 
      - Having the license expiration date on the license card just like the hunting licenses would be ideal.
